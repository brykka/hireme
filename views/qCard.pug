    // Remember that i.answers is a list when we built our data structure in
    // html.js. Here we are looping over that list. When you loop a list there
    // is the value of the item (in this case "answer") and there is also an
    // "index" value. The index is an automatically generated number which
    // represents the item's position within the list. We are getting the index
    // so that we can use it in our html attributes.
    each answer, index in i.answers
      div.answer= answer
        // Below we set value=index without quotes so that 'index' is treated as
        // a variable and not a string. The attribute will be rendered to the
        // page as an increasing integer for each answer on this card.
        //
        // Using &attributes we can combine a string ('answer') with the index
        // of each item in our list. So if we have an index of 1 the 'id'
        // attribute becomes 'answer1'
        // input(type='radio', name='answerBoxes_', value=index)&attributes({'id': 'answer' + index})
