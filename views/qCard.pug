    // Remember that i.answers is a list when we built our data structure in
    // html.js. Here we are looping over that list. When you loop a list there
    // is the value of the item (in this case "answer") and there is also an
    // "index" value. The index is an automatically generated number which
    // represents the item's position within the list. We are getting the index
    // so that we can use it in our html attributes.
    each answer, index in i.answers
      div#answer= answer
